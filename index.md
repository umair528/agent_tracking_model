## Welcome to Agent Based tracking model
## Introduction

Agent base tracking model is an idea to perform analysis on temporal data
of multiple agents in order to keep track of agents and nd correlation be-
tween agents. The assumptions are that system is facilitated with all agents
temporal data. Agent could be anything like vehicle, human, device etc. Any
moving object will be considered as an agent for agent tracking model. The
model will be helpful in addressing real-time industry specific problems like
mostly large organizations have concerns in keep in track of their vehicles
and want to restricts their vehicle and drivers in entering specific zones due
to some security and other reasons. The organizations also want to keep ac-
tivity log of every vehicle and driver to manage fuel and other expenses. The
overall monitoring will help them to cut of their expense leakages that are
taking place due to misuse of company or organization resources. The key
objective is to design a model in which end user would be able to monitor
and track agents with help of their temporal data stored in databases. In
case of vehicle tracking system enforce the parameters like Geo-fence viola-
tion, speed violation etc. The system keeps logs of each agent in case of any
violation inquiries.

### Objectives
1. Record each agent temporal data in database
2. Facilitate organization to generate organization employees summary report
3. Facilitate organization to generate activity report of individuals employees
4. Facilitate organization to keep track of registered agents
